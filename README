With bits of:

What it does:
1/ Get the list of hostname/owners
2/ Get a Splunk search result (by default, firewall logs of hosts not using the proxies)
3/ Get IPs' PTR records
4/ Massage the data to make it more usable
5/ Send found source hostnames to OpSec using https://github.com/mozilla/service-map/tree/master/python/pyservicelib
6/ File, update or close bugs to service owner's team, attaching the full list of flows

Outputs via stdout:
- Splunk search ID
- IPs that don't have a PTR record set in dns
- Hostnames that are not in opsec's DB
- Hostnames that don't have owners in opsec's DB
